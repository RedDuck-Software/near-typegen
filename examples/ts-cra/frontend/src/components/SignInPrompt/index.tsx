                Your contract is storing a greeting message in the NEAR blockchain. To
                change it you need to sign in using the NEAR Wallet. It is very simple,
                just use the button below.

                Do not worry, this app runs in the test network ("testnet"). It works
                just like the main network ("mainnet"), but using NEAR Tokens that are
                only for testing!
